# Feed reader testing
In this project i was asked to write tests for a web based feed reader.

The tests were created using the [Jasmine testing library](http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html).

To run the app with the tests download this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice. You can find the code for the tests within `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.
